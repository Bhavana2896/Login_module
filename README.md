A login module in Python typically involves storing and retrieving user credentials securely. One way to achieve this is by using the Pickle module in Python, which can serialize and deserialize Python objects into a binary format that can be stored in a file. 

This is a simple example of a login module in Python using Pickling and Unpickling consisting of 5 functions: loadall(),load_data(),register(),access(),home().

The loadall() function reads multiple values from the binary file until EOF error occurs.

The load_data() function creates a user_data dictionary of username & password from the data in the binary file.

The register() function gets a username and password as input, checks if user already exists & password conditions fulfillment and stores the credentials in a binary file called user_credential.txt using the pickle.dump() function.

The access() function takes a username and password as input, retrieves the user credential through the load_data() function and checks if the username exists in the dictionary and if the corresponding password matches the input password. If the credentials are valid, it prints "Login successful" “Hi {username}”, otherwise it prints “Username or password doesn’t exist”.

The home() function takes “Signup” or “Login” as input from the user and proceeds with user choice. If the user inputs any other option, it prints “Please enter an option” and restarts the process.
